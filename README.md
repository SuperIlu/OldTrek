- *startrek aka SUPER STARTREK* by Bob Leedom (C port by Chris Nystrom)
- *Trek* by Eric P Allman

I made them compile with DJGPP and Open Watcom v2, added/changed the Makefiles and bundled the EXE with the DOCs.
The programs start in DOSBox, gameplay is untested (by me)...

The files in the `OWatcom` directories (16 bit versions) should run rigth away, the ones in the DJGPP (32 bit versions) directory will need [CWSDPI](http://sandmann.dotster.com/cwsdpmi/) in the `PATH`.
