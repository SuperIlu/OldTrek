As usual the Makefiles were done completely from scratch.  The original
is in Makefile.orig.  Other than that, the source should still compile
under bsd.

Also as usual, set the DESTDIR in the Makefiles.  Also set the MANDIR in
the Makefile.

If you change any of the default default file placements remember to make
corresponding changes in the man page.
